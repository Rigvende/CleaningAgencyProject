# CleaningAgencyProject
Hello, everyone. \
This is my training project, which is a Java-based web application. It uses the Apache Tomcat container and the MySQL database.\
The theme of the project is a "Cleaning agency". \
In my implementation, this is an agency for cleaning and restoring burial sites called "Rest-in-Cleanliness". It's a pity but this fascinating idea has already existed.
