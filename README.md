# CleaningAgencyProject

This is my non-commercial project, which is a Java-based web application. It's written in the IntelliJ IDEA and uses the Apache Tomcat 9.0 container and the MySQL database.\
The theme of the project is a "Cleaning agency". \
In my implementation, this is an agency for cleaning and restoring burial sites called "Rest-in-Cleanliness". It's a pity but this fascinating idea has already existed :(
